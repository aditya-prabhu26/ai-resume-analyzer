## 📌 About the Project
 The AI Resume Reviewer is a web-based application that analyzes resumes and provides ATS-style evaluation using Artificial Intelligence. The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface and Groq API for AI-powered resume analysis. It helps users understand how well their resume matches common Applicant Tracking System (ATS) requirements and suggests improvements.

#### ..... The main aim of this project is to help students and job seekers understand:

    . How strong their resume is

    . Which sections need improvement

    . How ATS systems generally evaluate resumes


## ⚙️ What the Application Does

    . Allows the user to upload a resume in PDF or image format

    . Extracts text automatically from the uploaded resume

    . Calculates an ATS score out of 100 based on resume content

#### .... Shows section-wise ATS analysis:

  . Resume content

  . Contact information

  . Skills

  . Experience

  . Projects

#### ..... Displays the status of each section as:

  . No issues

  . Minor issues

  . Needs improvement

  . Uses AI to generate detailed feedback such as:

  . Strengths of the resume

  . Weaknesses

  . Missing skills or sections

  . Suggestions for improvement

  . Final verdict

## 🛠 Technologies Used

    . Python – main programming language

    . Streamlit – for building the web interface

    . Groq API (LLaMA 3.1) – for AI-based resume feedback

      Check version:

          python --version

  ### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

          python -m venv venv

      Activate it:

          venv\Scripts\activate

  ### 3️⃣ Install Required Libraries

          pip install streamlit groq pdfplumber pillow pytesseract

      This is required for reading text from image resumes.

          Download from:
          https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wik

   ### 5️⃣ Add Groq API Key

      In app.py and replace the API key placeholder:

          GROQ_API_KEY = "YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY"

  ### 6️⃣ Run the Application
          
          streamlit run app.py
